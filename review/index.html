    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p>My favorite album is Die Lit by Playboi Carti. It's my favorite album because it gives me more energy when I go to the gym. This album also included features by different artist like Travis Scott, Lil Uzi Vert, Chief Keef, and many more artist that are trending in music. </p>

    <h2><b>Playboi Carti</b></h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>Playboi Carti is an American rapper from Georgia, he's 25 years old. He debuted the album Die Lit on May 11, 2018 under the AWGE Label and Interscope Records. In the album Die Lit he included many features that give the album a different tone because the other artists give it their own touch to the songs.</p>

    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
    <h3>Long Time - Intro</h3>
    <p>The first song of the album is called Long Time - Intro, in the song you can get a picture of how the album is going to be because the beat is something different and hasn't been heard by any other rappers. My favorite lyrics from the song is "I'd rather die before I come in last", thats my favorite lyrics of the song because when I'm at the gym and want to give up on my set, I listen to it and it pushes me to continue finishing my set.
