    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Off-Roading</h3>
    <p>During the summer I go off-roading in my Jeep. Normally I go down to Tennessee with my uncles because down there they have more hills and places that are good for off-roading. I started off-roading since I got my license but at that time I didn't have my own car which wasn't to pleasing because I had to borrow a truck from my uncle but now that I have my own car I'm able to drive on the hills without having to worry about breaking someone elses vehicle.</p>

    <h3>Lifting Weights</h3>
    <p>Since I was fifteen years old I started to lift weights because I was in sports. After ending high school I still lift weights but nowadays I'm more limited do to having school in the morning then going staright to work. Sometimes I go to the gym after work but haven't been able stick to a routine. </p>
    <h3>Listening To Music</h3>
    <p>Everyday for the past five years I've been listening to music, most of the day. Since that moment that I wake up I put on my headphones and listen to music, and the only time I don't listen to music is when taking a shower and sleeping. Music helps me keep calm and it sometimes helps me focus on homework and at work, for me music is like my therapy.</p>
